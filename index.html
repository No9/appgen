<h2>A software development toolkit that lets you generate many different versions of the same app.</h2>

<p>The <em>appgen</em> module is a build tool similar to make or ant, except that
it can produce multiple versions of the same app from a common set of
resources. You can easily handle platform quirks, compatibility
issues, skinning, feature selection by defining variations within a
well-defined build structure.</p>

<p>The <em>appgen</em> module can help you build HTML5 cross-platform apps,
hybrid apps, native apps, or entire services that need to have mobile,
tablet, web, tv or other interfaces.</p>

<p>You can also buils variants of the same app, where you need to reskin
for different clients, or pick and choose features. You can even build
apps on demand.</p>

<p>You still have to provide the app source code, of course, but instead
of tearing your hair out with CSS hacks, platform sniffing <em>if</em>
statements, and last minute cut-and-paste desparation, you can get
your code back under control.</p>
